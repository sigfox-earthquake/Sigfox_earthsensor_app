Will need homebrew for the installation.
git clone repo

*`brew install npm@4` 
npm version 5 have some bugs so we use v4.

*`brew install watchman`
watchman for reloading app when changes are saved, very useful for development

* `npm install`

* `npm install firebase`

You can use your phone to try the app, download the expo app, and run 

* `npm run start` 
in the terminal, you should get a qr code you can scan with the app, then you can use the app on your phone!

You can also use other emulators as well.
